# Worlds

These are the worlds we choose to create for ourselves. Worlds filled with violence, chaos and war. Maybe its because man was never able to find peace inside of himself. He is constantly at war with his own desires and feelings. And so he creates violence externally because he has never experienced true internal peace.
